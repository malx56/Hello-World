# Hello-World
My first GitHub post /repository.
My name is Malcolm I am teaching myself Pyton programing.
I am exploring GitHub to see what it's about and how can I use it.
After exploring the Raspberry Pi and building circuits and writing code to inter act
with them.  I bought a Arduino Uno and have come to relie onGitHub to get libraries 
for most if not all my projects!
I haven't thought of a project / creation so I'm brushing up on my sodering skills, circuit building, 
and troubleshooting them.  One day I'm going to post my own code!

I also enjoy Fly Tying, and Fly Fishing.  Living in the Pacific Northwest is almost the most perfect place!
